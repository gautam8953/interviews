	var obj2={};    
	ws.add(obj1);

Q. What is the use of a Map object in JavaScript?

	function display()  
	{  
	var map=new Map();    
	map.set(1,"jQuery");    
	map.set(2,"AngularJS");    
	map.set(3,"Bootstrap");    
	document.writeln(map.get(1)+"<br>");    
	document.writeln(map.get(2)+"<br>");    
	document.writeln(map.get(3));    
	}

Q. What is the use of a WeakMap object in JavaScript?

   Here, the keys are objects and the values are arbitrary values. For example:

function display()  
{  
var wm = new WeakMap();    
var obj1 = {};    
var obj2 = {};    
var obj3= {};    
wm.set(obj1, "jQuery");    
wm.set(obj2, "AngularJS");    
wm.set(obj3,"Bootstrap");    
document.writeln(wm.has(obj2));     
}     
display();	
	
Q.  What is an observable?

    Observable :	                                     
    1. Declarative: Computation does not start until subscription so that they can be run whenever you need the result	                   
    2. Provide multiple values over time	                                                                                                  
    3. Subscribe method is used for error handling which makes centralized and predictable error handling	                                  
    4. Provides chaining and subscription to handle complex applications
