   BOM stands for Browser Object Model. It provides interaction with the browser. The default object of a browser is a window. 
   So, you can call all the functions of the window by specifying the window or directly. 
   The window object provides various properties like document, history, screen, navigator, location, innerHeight, innerWidth,

Q. In which location cookies are stored on the hard disk?
	Netscape Navigator - c:\Program Files\Netscape\Users\username\cookies.txt
	Internet Explorer - c:\Windows\Cookies\username@Website.txt.
	
Q. What's the difference between event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation() methods in JavaScript?
A. In JavaScript, the event.preventDefault() method is used to prevent the default behavior of an element. 
   On the other hand, the event.stopPropagation() method is used to stop the propagation of an event or 
   stop the event from occurring in the bubbling or capturing phase.
   
Q. How can you check if the event.preventDefault() method was used in an element?
A. When we use the event.defaultPrevent() method in the event object returns a Boolean indicating that 
	the event.preventDefault() was called in a particular element.
	
Q. What are the different data types present in JavaScript?
   There are two types of data types in JavaScript:
	1. Primitive data types  - String, Number, Boolean, BigInt, Undefined, Null, typeof
	2. Non- Primitive data types  - Object, Array,
	
Q. Name the types of functions in JS?
	1. named function  : Named function is the function that we define it in the code and then call it 
		whenever we need it by referencing its name and passing some arguments to it
		function(a, b) {
			console.log(a+b);
		} 
	2. anonymous function : The anonymous functions don’t have names. 
		They need to be tied to something: variable or an event to run.
		let oddEven=function(number){
			if(number%2==0){ return 'EVEN'; } else { return 'ODD'; }			
		}
	3. Immediately invoked function expression : Invoked function expression runs as soon as the browser encounters it. 
		The benefit of this function is that it runs immediately where it’s located in the code and produces a direct output.
		let message =(function(){
			let name = 'gauam'; return name;
		})();
		// imeediatly creates output 
		result; // gautam

Q. Tell something about the undeclared and undefined variables? 
Ans.  undeclared -> not exist, not declared
      undefined -> exist, defined but value not assigned

Q. Variable Declaration vs. Initialization
A. For storing any value, we need a variable, so first, we will declare a var variable 
	and then initialize the value into the variable.
	var myName;  //   declaration
	myName = "my name";  //   initialization
	var myName = "my name";  //   declaration and initialization at the same time
	
Q. what does Scope means?
A. Scope stands for where our variable will be available to use inside our code and where it will not.  
	Function scope : means variable will only be available to use inside the function where it is declared, 
		will not be accessible outside of function
	Block-scope : Block means a pair of curly brackets, a block can be anything that contains an opening and closing curly bracket.
		Variable having Block-scope will only be available to use inside the block it declared

Q. Hoisting of var Variable
A. hoisting, it's a feature provided by javascript which moves variables and functions to the top of scope 
	before code execution and gets assigned the value of undefined.

Q. differene in let, var and const?
	VAR : 
		var has the function or global scope.
		It gets hoisted to the top of its scope 
		it is initialized undefined by default
		It can be updated 
		It can be re-declared.
		It's an old way to declare a variable.
	
		Var variable is the old way to declare a variable in javascript; var variable has the function scope, 
		But global scope when it is declared outside the function.
		var variable can be re-declared and updated. re-declaration allows declaring more than one variable with the same name, 
		because of this reason, if we declare a new variable by mistake, it will override the original variable value
		
		var name = "my name";
		var myAge = 22;
		if(myAge > 18) {
			var name = "another person name";
		}
		console.log(name); //output => "another person name"
	LET : 
		let's have the block scope.
		It also got hoisted to the top of its scope 
		but didn't initialize.
		It can only be updated 
		and can't be re-declared.
		It's a new way to declare variables introduced in ES6.
	
		Let variable introduce a special feature that does not allow re-declaration of variables.
		The let variable has block scope. let variable also get hoisted to the top of the scope But does not get assigned any value.
		
		let myName = "my name";
		let myName = "my new name";
		console.log(myName); //output => SyntaxError: redeclaration of let myName
		
	CONST : 
		const variable has the block scope.
		It also got hoisted to the top of its scope 
		but didn't initialize.
		It can't be updated 
		It can't be re-declared.
		It's also a new way to declare a variable, which introduces in ES6.
		
		
		const declarations are block-scoped. cann't be redclared and re-intialised
	
Q. what is cursor in js?
A. JavaScript cursor is a thing used as a mouse cursor whenever it’s going to point on specific elements. 
   There are various types of cursor available those are like wait, help, move, pointer, crosshair, cell, not allowed, zoom-in, zoom-out, etc. 
   This cursor can be changed by assigning value to document.body.style.cursor.
   
Q. How to set the cursor to wait in JavaScript?
A. The cursor can be set to wait in JavaScript by using the property "cursor". The following example illustrates the usage:
	<script>

	</script>
	
Q. What are the pop-up boxes available in JavaScript?
   Alert Box : An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.
		alert("I am an alert box!");
   Confirm Box : A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.
		if (confirm("Press a button!")) {
		  txt = "You pressed OK!";
		} else {
		  txt = "You pressed Cancel!";
		}
   Prompt Box : A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.

Q. What is the difference between 'View state' and 'Session state'?
A. "View state" is specific to a page in a session whereas "Session state" is specific to a user or browser 
   that can be accessed across all pages in the web application.

Q. Define closure.
   In JavaScript, we need closures when a variable which is defined outside the scope in reference is accessed from some inner scope.
	var num = 10;  
	function sum()   
	{  
	document.writeln(num+num);  
	}   
	sum();

Q. How to handle exceptions in JavaScript?
A.  By the help of try/catch block, we can handle exceptions in JavaScript. 
	JavaScript supports try, catch, finally and throw keywords for exception handling.
	
	The try statement defines a code block to run (to try).
	The catch statement defines a code block to handle any error.
	The finally statement defines a code block to run regardless of the result.
	The throw statement defines a custom error.
	
	try {
		// executable code here
	  }
	  catch(err) {
		message.innerHTML = "Error: " + err + ".";
	  }
	  finally {
		document.getElementById("demo").value = "";
	  }
	
Q. What is the use of debugger keyword in JavaScript?
A. JavaScript debugger keyword sets the breakpoint through the code itself. The debugger stops the execution of the program at the position it is applied.
	
Q. What is the role of a strict mode in JavaScript?
A. JavaScript's strict mode, introduced in ECMAScript 5. This expression can only be placed as the first statement in a script or a function.
   It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.
   The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".
   With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.
   
Q. What are the falsy values in JavaScript, and how can we check if a value is falsy?
A. Those values which become false while converting to Boolean are called falsy values.
	const falsyValues = ['', 0, null, undefined, NaN, false];   
	We can check if a value is falsy by using the Boolean function or the Double NOT operator (!!).
	
Q. What do you understand by hoisting in JavaScript?
A. Hoisting is the default behavior of JavaScript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top.

Q. What does the isNaN() function?
   The isNan() function returns true if the variable value is not a number.
   
Q. explain foreach in javasccript   
   
Q. how to remove an element from an array?

Q. What is the use of a Date object in JavaScript?
A. The JavaScript date object can be used to get a year, month and day. You can display a timer on the webpage by the help of JavaScript date object.

	function display()  
	{  
	  var date=new Date();    
	var day=date.getDate();    
	var month=date.getMonth()+1;    
	var year=date.getFullYear();    
	document.write("<br>Date is: "+day+"/"+month+"/"+year);    
	}  
	display();
	
Q. What is the use of a Set object in JavaScript?
A.  The JavaScript Set object is used to store the elements with unique values. The values can be of any type i.e. whether primitive values or object references. 
	For example:
	function display()  
	{  
	var set = new Set();    
	set.add("jQuery");    
	set.add("AngularJS");    
	set.add("Bootstrap");    
	for (let elements of set) {    
	 document.writeln(elements+"<br>");    
	}     
	}  
	display();
	
Q. What is the use of a WeakSet object in JavaScript?
A. The JavaScript WeakSet object is the type of collection that allows us to store weakly held objects. Unlike Set, the WeakSet are the collections of objects only. 
	It doesn't contain the arbitrary values. For example:

	function display()  
	{  
	var ws = new WeakSet();    
	var obj1={};    
	var obj2={};    
	ws.add(obj1);    
	ws.add(obj2);    
	//Let's check whether the WeakSet object contains the added object    
	document.writeln(ws.has(obj1)+"<br>");    
	document.writeln(ws.has(obj2));     
	}     
	display();
	
Q. What is the use of a Map object in JavaScript?
A. The JavaScript Map object is used to map keys to values. It stores each element as key-value pair. 
    It operates the elements such as search, update and delete on the basis of specified key. For example:

	function display()  
	{  
	var map=new Map();    
	map.set(1,"jQuery");    
	map.set(2,"AngularJS");    
	map.set(3,"Bootstrap");    
	document.writeln(map.get(1)+"<br>");    
	document.writeln(map.get(2)+"<br>");    
	document.writeln(map.get(3));    
	}  
	display();
Q. What is the use of a WeakMap object in JavaScript?
A. The JavaScript WeakMap object is a type of collection which is almost similar to Map. 
   It stores each element as a key-value pair where keys are weakly referenced. 
   Here, the keys are objects and the values are arbitrary values. For example:

function display()  
{  
var wm = new WeakMap();    
var obj1 = {};    
var obj2 = {};    
var obj3= {};    
wm.set(obj1, "jQuery");    
wm.set(obj2, "AngularJS");    
wm.set(obj3,"Bootstrap");    
document.writeln(wm.has(obj2));     
}     
display();	
	
Q.  What is an observable?

Q. waht is promise and what are different states of promise?

Q. What is the difference between promise and observable?
   Promise:
   1. Execute immediately on creation
   2. Provide only one
   3. Push errors to the child promises
   4. Uses only .then() clause
   
    Observable :	                                     
    1. Declarative: Computation does not start until subscription so that they can be run whenever you need the result	                   
    2. Provide multiple values over time	                                                                                                  
    3. Subscribe method is used for error handling which makes centralized and predictable error handling	                                  
    4. Provides chaining and subscription to handle complex applications
