Q. what is decorator in angular : Decorators are functions that are invoked with a prefixed @ symbol, and are immediately followed by a class, method or property. 
   They allow a service, directive or filter to be changed before being used. Basically, a decorator provides configuration metadata that determines how the component, 
   class or a function should be processed, instantiated and used at runtime
  -> Types of Decorators - There are four types of decorators and each type further has its own subset of decorators
    1.class : This is the first type of decorator which tells us about a particular classâ€™s intent and helps answer questions like whether the class is a component or a module. 
          There are various Class decorators in Angular, and among them @Component and @NgModule are widely used
    2.method : Method decorators, as the name indicates, are used to decorate the method defined inside our class with functionality
    3.property : Property decorators are used to decorate specific properties inside a class. Using a property decorator, 
           we can easily identify why we use any particular property of a class Like @Input (), @Output, @ReadOnly (), @Override ()
    4.Parameter Decorators: Parameter decorators allow us to decorate parameters in our class constructors.  
           @Inject () is a common and widely used parameter decorator. Using this decorator, we can inject services in Angular classes

    Provide multiple values over time	                                                                                                  Provide only one
    Subscribe method is used for error handling which makes centralized and predictable error handling	                                  Push errors to the child promises
    Provides chaining and subscription to handle complex applications	                                                                  Uses only .then() clause
