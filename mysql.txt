Q. name different type of indexes in mysql
A. A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of operations in a table. 
    Practically, indexes are also a type of tables, which keep primary key or index field and a pointer to each record into the actual table.
    The INSERT and UPDATE statements take more time on tables having indexes, whereas the SELECT statements become fast on those tables. 
    The reason is that while doing insert or update, a database needs to insert or update the index values as well.
    1. Unique - The Unique index in MySQL specifies that all values in the columns of a table must be distinct when applied. 
        single column : no duplicate value 
        multi column : grouping of column values in every row should be unique
        unique coumn can have single null value but it depends on language. ANSI SQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL allows columns with UNIQUE constraints to have multiple NULLs.
        “NULL” is not a value in itself and since it is not a value, it is not comparable at all, so it can be multiple.
        but NULL=NULL is true, so many dbms implements unique column with single null value like mysql,  Microsoft sql server
        CREATE UNIQUE INDEX Indexname ON Tablename(indexcolumn1, indexcolumn2,…);
        OR,
        CREATE TABLE Tablename(Column1 CHAR (30) NOT NULL, UNIQUE INDEX (column2));
        OR,
        ALTER TABLE Tablename ADD UNIQUE INDEX (column1, column2);
    2. Primary Key - uniquely identifies a row in tables. unique+not null = primary  key
        CREATE TABLE Tablename (Columnname Data_type PRIMARY KEY );
        OR,
        CREATE TABLE Tablename (Column1 CHAR(30) NOT NULL, Column2 CHAR(30) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (Column1, Column2));
        OR,
        ALTER TABLE Tablename ADD PRIMARY KEY(Column1, Column2);
    3. Simple | Regular | Normal
        this type of Index named simple, regular, or normal, the specified column values do not require to be unique and can be NULL. 
        They essentially supplement the database searching process to make record retrieval faster
        CREATE INDEX Indexname ON Tablename  (Indexcolumn1, Indexcolumn2, …);
        OR,
        CREATE TABLE Tablename(Column1 CHAR(30) NOT NULL, INDEX(Column2));
        OR,
        ALTER TABLE Tablename ADD INDEX(Column1, Column2);
    4. Full-Text
        This index type is implemented for full-text searches. suppose you need to find a blob that includes a certain word or combination of words, 
        or it can even be a substring within the higher block text. 
        these indexes are maintained only for MyISAM and InnoDB tables in the database and can consist of only VARCHAR, CHAR, and TEXT table columns.
        CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX Indexname ON Tablename(indexcolumn1, indexcolumn2, …);
        OR,
        CREATE TABLE Tablename (column1 TEXT, FULLTEXT(column1));
        OR,
        ALTER TABLE Tablename ADD FULLTEXT(column1, column2);
    5. Spatial
        MySQL allows the creation of Spatial indexes on geometry-valued columns with NOT NULL constraint.
        The spatial index creates an R-tree index. The engine builds up a B-tree index for storage engines that maintain nonspatial indexing of the spatial table columns
        CREATE INDEX Indexname ON Tablename(Indexcolumn1);
        OR,
        CREATE TABLE Tablename (column1 GEOMETRY NOT NULL SRID 4326,SPATIAL INDEX(Column2));
        OR,
        ALTER TABLE Tablename ADD SPATIAL INDEX (column1, column2);
    6. Descending
        Version 8+ of MySQL offers the Descending index, a consistent index stored in the inverse order
        It supports users when they run queries to find out the most newly added data
        CREATE INDEX Indexname ON Tablename (Indexcolumn1 DESC);
        OR,
        CREATE TABLE Tablename (Column1 INT, Column2 INT, INDEX asc_index1(Column1 ASC, Column2 ASC), INDEX desc_index1 (Column1 DESC,      Column2 DESC));
        OR,
        ALTER TABLE Tablename ADD INDEX(column1 DESC, column2 ASC);

Q. if you got the files of mysql myISM databs, can you restore it or get data back from it
A.    yes. stop server, place file in mysql/data folder then restart. files - (tablename.FRM, tablename.MYD, tablename.MYI)
    .frm – The table format containing the table structure or table definition.
    .myi – The index file with indexes for each table.
    .myd – The data file that contains data of each table.

Q. if you have to transfer data from one server to another what are different ideas?
    1. PC to PC using third party software. ex- EaseUS Todo PCTrans runs full compatible with SQL server 2004
    2. using Copy Database Wizard - if in same PC
    3. using backup and store - download sql 
    4. using master slave- 

Q. what are storage engines and name different type of storage engines in mysql. 
A.
Engine     | Support | Comment                                                        | Transactions | XA   | Savepoints |
+------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------+------+------------+

+------------+---------+------------------------------------------------------
*The MERGE engine is an exceedingly effective way of querying data from multiple, identically defined, tables.
*The MEMORY engine is the best way to perform a large number of complex queries on data that would be inefficient to search on a disk based engine.
*The CSV engine is a great way to export data that could be used in other applications.
*BDB is excellent for data that has a unique key that is frequently accessed.

Q. what is the difference between myISAM and Innodb?
A. MyISAM and InnoDB are the most commonly used engines.
    MyISAM is slightly faster than InnoDB, and implements the FULLTEXT index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities. 
    MyISAM is not transacted and doesn't implement foreign key constraints, which is a major drawback.
    if you have a high number of updates or inserts compared to your searches and selects then you will get better performance out of the InnoDB engine.
    My|sam and innodb diference
    MYISAM:
    1.	MYISAM supports Table-level Locking
    2.	MyISAM designed for need of speed
    3.	MyISAM does not support foreign keys hence we call MySQL with MYISAM is DBMS
    4.	MyISAM stores its tables, data and indexes in diskspace using separate three different files. (tablename.FRM, tablename.MYD, tablename.MYI)
    5.	MYISAM not supports transaction. You cannot commit and rollback with MYISAM. Once you issue a command it’s done.
    6. does not support ACID property of database
    7.	MYISAM supports fulltext search
    8.	You can use MyISAM, if the table is more static with lots of select and less update and delete.
    9: develop by ibm to store data like tape. 
    10. mysql indexed sequential access method(FULL FORM)
    INNODB:
    1.	InnoDB supports Row-level Locking
    2.	InnoDB designed for maximum performance when processing high volume of data
    3.	InnoDB support foreign keys hence we call MySQL with InnoDB is RDBMS
    4.	InnoDB stores its tables and indexes in a tablespace
    5.	InnoDB supports transaction. You can commit and rollback with InnoDB
    6.  support ACID property of database

query to get table list uing MyISAM engine : SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = ‘database_name’ AND ENGINE = ‘MyISAM’;
query to change engine : ALTER TABLE `table_name` ENGINE = InnoDB; 


Q. explain acid property
A. In order to maintain consistency in a database, before and after the transaction, certain properties are followed. These are called ACID properties
    1. Atomicity: either the entire transaction takes place at once or doesn’t happen at all.  i.e. transactions do not occur partially.
    Atomicity is also known as the ‘All or nothing rule’. 
    It involves the following two operations. 
    —Abort: If a transaction aborts, changes made to the database are not visible. 
    —Commit: If a transaction commits, changes made are visible. 
    2. Consistency : databse must be consistent before and after the transection
    3. Isolation : multiple transection occurs independentally without interference 
    4. Durability : changes of a successfull transection occurs even if the system failure occurs

A. Trigerss allowed insert, update,delete on before or after each, means 6 combination of 2 each

Q. what is the difference between group by and  having clause?
    Having Clause is basically like the aggregate function with the GROUP BY clause. 
    The HAVING clause is used instead of WHERE with aggregate functions. While the GROUP BY Clause groups rows that have the same values into summary rows. The having clause is used with the where clause in order to find rows with certain conditions. The having clause is always used after the group By clause.

    FROM  Employee Emp2 
    WHERE Emp2.Salary > Emp1.Salary)
    
Q. Select record of all employee  whose salary is 2nd highest.
A. select * from sallary where sallary = (select distinct sallary from sallary order by sallary desc limit 1,1)
   SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee WHERE Salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee )
   
Q. fetch record of all employee have 4th highest sallery
A. first query select first element from top and it is in ascending means lowest at top and 
second query selects top “n” query from table and it is descending means if we want 3rd highest first we select 3 hightest sallery in descending order than will arrange it to ascending and select first that is desire 3rd highest.
