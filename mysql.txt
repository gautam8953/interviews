Q. name different type of indexes in mysql
A. A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of operations in a table. 
    Practically, indexes are also a type of tables, which keep primary key or index field and a pointer to each record into the actual table.
    The INSERT and UPDATE statements take more time on tables having indexes, whereas the SELECT statements become fast on those tables. 
    The reason is that while doing insert or update, a database needs to insert or update the index values as well.
    1. Unique - The Unique index in MySQL specifies that all values in the columns of a table must be distinct when applied. 
        single column : no duplicate value 
        multi column : grouping of column values in every row should be unique
        unique coumn can have single null value but it depends on language. ANSI SQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL allows columns with UNIQUE constraints to have multiple NULLs.
        “NULL” is not a value in itself and since it is not a value, it is not comparable at all, so it can be multiple.
        but NULL=NULL is true, so many dbms implements unique column with single null value like mysql,  Microsoft sql server
    INDEX, UNIQUE, PRIMARY


Q. if you got the files of mysql myISM databs, can you restore it or get data back from it
    yes. stop server, place file in mysql/data folder then restart
Q. if you have to transfer data from one server to another what are different ideas?
    download sql, master slave, transfer data by connecting to another

Q. what are storage engines and name different type of storage engines in mysql. 
A.
Engine     | Support | Comment                                                        | Transactions | XA   | Savepoints |
+------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------+------+------------+
| InnoDB     | YES     | Supports transactions, row-level locking, and foreign keys     | YES          | YES  | YES        |
| MRG_MYISAM | YES     | Collection of identical MyISAM tables                          | NO           | NO   | NO         |
| BLACKHOLE  | YES     | /dev/null storage engine (anything you write to it disappears) | NO           | NO   | NO         |
| CSV        | YES     | CSV storage engine                                             | NO           | NO   | NO         |
| MEMORY     | YES     | Hash based, stored in memory, useful for temporary tables      | NO           | NO   | NO         |
| FEDERATED  | NO      | Federated MySQL storage engine                                 | NULL         | NULL | NULL       |
| ARCHIVE    | YES     | Archive storage engine                                         | NO           | NO   | NO         |
| MyISAM     | DEFAULT | Default engine as of MySQL 3.23 with great performance         | NO           | NO   | NO         |
+------------+---------+------------------------------------------------------
*The MERGE engine is an exceedingly effective way of querying data from multiple, identically defined, tables.
*The MEMORY engine is the best way to perform a large number of complex queries on data that would be inefficient to search on a disk based engine.
*The CSV engine is a great way to export data that could be used in other applications.
*BDB is excellent for data that has a unique key that is frequently accessed.

Q. what is the difference between myISAM and Innodb?
A. MyISAM and InnoDB are the most commonly used engines.
MyISAM is slightly faster than InnoDB, and implements the FULLTEXT index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities. MyISAM is not transacted and doesn't implement foreign key constraints, which is a major drawback.
if you have a high number of updates or inserts compared to your searches and selects then you will get better performance out of the InnoDB engine.
My|sam and innodb diference
MYISAM:
1.	MYISAM supports Table-level Locking
2.	MyISAM designed for need of speed
3.	MyISAM does not support foreign keys hence we call MySQL with MYISAM is DBMS
4.	MyISAM stores its tables, data and indexes in diskspace using separate three different files. (tablename.FRM, tablename.MYD, tablename.MYI)
5.	MYISAM not supports transaction. You cannot commit and rollback with MYISAM. Once you issue a command it’s done.
6.	MYISAM supports fulltext search
7.	You can use MyISAM, if the table is more static with lots of select and less update and delete.
8: develop by ibm to store data like tape. 
9. mysql indexed sequential access method(FULL FORM)
INNODB:
1.	InnoDB supports Row-level Locking
2.	InnoDB designed for maximum performance when processing high volume of data
3.	InnoDB support foreign keys hence we call MySQL with InnoDB is RDBMS
4.	InnoDB stores its tables and indexes in a tablespace
5.	InnoDB supports transaction. You can commit and rollback with InnoDB

Q. what is the difference between group by and  having clause?
    Having Clause is basically like the aggregate function with the GROUP BY clause. 
    The HAVING clause is used instead of WHERE with aggregate functions. While the GROUP BY Clause groups rows that have the same values into summary rows. The having clause is used with the where clause in order to find rows with certain conditions. The having clause is always used after the group By clause.

    );
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX indexName ON tableName (ID, LName, FName, LOC);
    DROP INDEX indexName ON tableName;

Q. write a query to find the age of an employee from his dob stored
    SELECT DATE_FORMAT(FROM_DAYS(DATEDIFF(now(),'2010-11-25')), '%Y')+0 AS Age;    
Q. write diffrent query to find the 2nd, 3rd, 4th highest/lowest salary and fetching all records containing these salries
A. SELECT DISTINCT(column name) FROM table ORDER BY (column name) desc LIMIT n-1,1
    SELECT * FROM Employee Emp1 
    WHERE (N-1) = ( 
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(Emp2.Salary)) 
    FROM  Employee Emp2 
    WHERE Emp2.Salary > Emp1.Salary)
    
Q. Select record of all employee  whose salary is 2nd highest.
A. select * from sallary where sallary = (select distinct sallary from sallary order by sallary desc limit 1,1)
   SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee WHERE Salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee )
   
Q. fetch record of all employee have 4th highest sallery
A. first query select first element from top and it is in ascending means lowest at top and 
second query selects top “n” query from table and it is descending means if we want 3rd highest first we select 3 hightest sallery in descending order than will arrange it to ascending and select first that is desire 3rd highest.
