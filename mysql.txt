Q. name different type of indexes in mysql
Q. write a query to find the age of an employee from his dob stored
Q. if you got the files of mysql myISM databs, can you restore it or get data back from it
Q. if you have to transfer data from one server to another waht are different ideas?
Q. write diffrent query to find the 2nd, 3rd, 4th highest/lowest salary and fetching all records containing these salries
A. SELECT DISTINCT(column name) FROM table ORDER BY (column name) desc LIMIT n-1,1

SELECT * FROM Employee Emp1 
WHERE (N-1) = ( 
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(Emp2.Salary)) 
    FROM  Employee Emp2 
    WHERE Emp2.Salary > Emp1.Salary)
    
Q. Select record of all employee  whose salary is 2nd highest.
A. select * from sallary where sallary = (select distinct sallary from sallary order by sallary desc limit 1,1)
   SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee WHERE Salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee )
   
Q. fetch record of all employee have 4th highest sallery
A. first query select first element from top and it is in ascending means lowest at top and 
second query selects top “n” query from table and it is descending means if we want 3rd highest first we select 3 hightest sallery in descending order than will arrange it to ascending and select first that is desire 3rd highest.
SELECT MIN(EmpSalary) from (
SELECT EmpSalary from Employee ORDER BY EmpSalary DESC LIMIT 3
);
SELECT DISTINCT(Salary) FROM table ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT n-1,1;

Q. what are storage engines and name different type of storage engines in mysql. 
A.
Engine     | Support | Comment                                                        | Transactions | XA   | Savepoints |
+------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------+------+------------+
| InnoDB     | YES     | Supports transactions, row-level locking, and foreign keys     | YES          | YES  | YES        |
| MRG_MYISAM | YES     | Collection of identical MyISAM tables                          | NO           | NO   | NO         |
| BLACKHOLE  | YES     | /dev/null storage engine (anything you write to it disappears) | NO           | NO   | NO         |
| CSV        | YES     | CSV storage engine                                             | NO           | NO   | NO         |
| MEMORY     | YES     | Hash based, stored in memory, useful for temporary tables      | NO           | NO   | NO         |
| FEDERATED  | NO      | Federated MySQL storage engine                                 | NULL         | NULL | NULL       |
| ARCHIVE    | YES     | Archive storage engine                                         | NO           | NO   | NO         |
| MyISAM     | DEFAULT | Default engine as of MySQL 3.23 with great performance         | NO           | NO   | NO         |
+------------+---------+------------------------------------------------------
*The MERGE engine is an exceedingly effective way of querying data from multiple, identically defined, tables.
*The MEMORY engine is the best way to perform a large number of complex queries on data that would be inefficient to search on a disk based engine.
*The CSV engine is a great way to export data that could be used in other applications.
*BDB is excellent for data that has a unique key that is frequently accessed.

Q. what is the difference between myISAM and Innodb?
A. MyISAM and InnoDB are the most commonly used engines.
MyISAM is slightly faster than InnoDB, and implements the FULLTEXT index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities. MyISAM is not transacted and doesn't implement foreign key constraints, which is a major drawback.
if you have a high number of updates or inserts compared to your searches and selects then you will get better performance out of the InnoDB engine.
My|sam and innodb diference
MYISAM:
1.	MYISAM supports Table-level Locking
2.	MyISAM designed for need of speed
3.	MyISAM does not support foreign keys hence we call MySQL with MYISAM is DBMS
4.	MyISAM stores its tables, data and indexes in diskspace using separate three different files. (tablename.FRM, tablename.MYD, tablename.MYI)
5.	MYISAM not supports transaction. You cannot commit and rollback with MYISAM. Once you issue a command it’s done.
6.	MYISAM supports fulltext search
7.	You can use MyISAM, if the table is more static with lots of select and less update and delete.
INNODB:
1.	InnoDB supports Row-level Locking
2.	InnoDB designed for maximum performance when processing high volume of data
3.	InnoDB support foreign keys hence we call MySQL with InnoDB is RDBMS
4.	InnoDB stores its tables and indexes in a tablespace
5.	InnoDB supports transaction. You can commit and rollback with InnoDB

Q. Write Query to change type of database engine in mysql?
A. ALTER TABLE t ENGINE = MYISAM;

Q. what is triger?
Q. what is the difference between group by and  having clause?
Q. what is indexing and how to achieve it
A. maximum 16 index can be defined in  a table

Q. how to check number result obtained byy mysql
Q. query for getting all vote to a candidate from two table(one has voter name, one has parties and other has vote)
Q. explain acid property
Q. what is transaction
Q. difference between delete & truncate
Q. what are joins
Q. what is subquery
Q. sql injuctions

indexes andits uses, 
heap tables what is
default port of mysql : 3306
enum and sets
char and varchar
get  version of mysql : select version();
primary key & candidate key
what are federated tables: which allow access to the tables located on other database on another servers
autoincrement: automatically increased value. When maximum value reached it stops and error flashed
how to see indexes defind for a table: show index from tablename
% and _ and like uery
Difference in like and regrex operators
Difference in blob and text
Myisam: develop by ibm to store data like tape. Full form: mysql indexed sequential access method
By using created statement we can create database, event, function, index, procedure, table, trigger, user, view
Trigerss allowed insert, update,delete on before or after each, means 6 combination of 2 each
Common sql function
Rdms and itrs features and dbms
Data mining means
Maximum 64 colums can be updated in a single query, 64 chars leght name can be create
Ddl, dml, dcl
Delete vs truncate
Heap and temporary table
Float nad doubles
Char vs varchar: 255,4000 charcters, fixed size, variable, 50% faster is char than varchar, static memory allocation usred, dyanamic used
Mysql connect nad mysql p connect

Nth salary : select distict(salary0 from emp order by salary desc limit n-1,1
fro getting latest record in group by query
SELECT id, branchId, roleId FROM mapping WHERE id IN ( SELECT MAX(id) FROM mapping GROUP BY branchId )
Primary vs unique
